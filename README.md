How the Tool Works:
User selects mode: 
- encode image
- select your image and and hidden message
- to decode the message;
- select the image in which you have hide the message
- and decode your message will be shown in the textbox.

   Next Steps (Planned):
  - Add basic encryption (e.g., XOR or password-based)
  - Show progress bar while encoding/decoding
  - Add drag-and-drop file support
  - Export as a .exe file
